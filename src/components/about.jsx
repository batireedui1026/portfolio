          I'm a designer turned full stack developer, passionate about React.js
          and <br />
          Node.js. I excel in blending technical and visual aspects to craft
          exceptional
          <br />
          digital products, prioritizing user experience, precise design, and
          optimized <br />
          code.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since starting my web development journey in 2015, I've embraced
          <br />
          challenges and kept up with the latest tech trends. Now in my early
          thirties,
          <br />
          seven years in, I'm building cutting-edge web apps using Next.js,
          TypeScript,
          <br />
          Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase, and more.
          <br />
          <br />
          With a progressive mindset, I enjoy the entire product development
          process,
          <br />
          from ideation to execution. Off duty, you'll find me on Twitter,
          tracking <br />
          startup journeys, or unwinding. Follow me for tech insights and public
          project <br /> updates on Twitter or GitHub.

          Finally, some quick bits about me.
